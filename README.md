A mobile application developed as a step towards helping the malnourished and underserved children of today to become the healthy youth of tomorrow.

three types of users: Hospital, Anganwadi and NRC. 
Hospitals and Anganwadi can check bed availability at NRCs and send 
referrals for a child with SAM to any of the NRC. The referrals are then managed by 
NRCs. NRCs can admit a child ,app will assign a bed hence also managing the bed 
availability. A time period for admission is initially assigned to the child which can be 
extended later if child doesn't fully recover. NRCs can discharge the child, app will 
withhold bed contributing to bed availability management, after which a number of 
follow-ups are scheduled in the app. Follow-ups can be extended if found necessary. 
NRCs can also increase or decrease the total bed count if upgrading or downgrading.

NRC refer to Nutritional Habilitation centre and SAM refer to semi acute malnourished.

The App is made using Android Studio and Java. cloud firestore was used for database and Firebase for authentication and files storage.
